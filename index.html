        <p>“I have worked with a lot of people in my tenure at S1 and I have never seen a new employee fresh out of College be able to do so much in so little time as Shariva. She demonstrated over and over great technical skills as well as work commitment. She grew a lot in the time she was with us and I would highly recommend her to anybody who is looking for a talented software developer.”

            “As a Product Manager, working with Shariva verma as a developer is easy and enjoyable. Shariva has a very high standard for her development output, which means she nearly everything she produces meets expectations. When bugs are found, she is quick to find an acceptable resolution. Shariva is also very careful to ask questions and ensure they are answered to her satisfaction before proceeding down a particular technical design path. She is a strong developer, excited to learn and apply new technologies. Shariva is also very easy to communicate with and able to explain technical details to non-technical staff. "and as my mom I declare she is the best mom in the world!!!!!!!!!!!"
